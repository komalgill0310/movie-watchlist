# **Movie Watchlist**

# Overview

Welcome to **"Movie Watchlist"** â€“ a project created to simplify the process of managing a watchlist for movies. Users can easily search for movies using keywords and view relevant details such as the movie's poster, name, rating, duration, genre, and a brief description. Additionally, users can add movies to their watchlist for future viewing.

## What I've Learned

This project has enriched my knowledge in web development, focusing on the following key learnings:

- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**:  Implementing asynchronous data fetching using **'async/await'** to pull movie data from the Omdb API.

- **Local Storage Usage**: Utilizing local storage to store and retrieve the user's watchlist, providing a seamless experience across sessions.

## Getting Started

Explore the world of movies and build your watchlist by following these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
```
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/movie-watchlist.git
```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the project directory using the following command:
```
    cd movie-watchlist
```

3. **Open the HTML File**: Open the **index.html** file in your preferred web browser.

4. **Search for Movies**: Type keywords in the search box to find relevant movies. View movie details and add them to your watchlist.

5. **View Watchlist**: Click on **"My Watchlist"** to see the movies you've added. Remove movies or go back to the search page for more.

6. **Persistent Watchlist**: Your watchlist is stored in local storage, ensuring it's available even when you return to the site.

## Features
